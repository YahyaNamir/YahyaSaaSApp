Here's an updated `README.md` template for a Next.js application as of 2025:

```markdown
# Next.js Application

This is a Next.js application, a powerful React framework that provides an optimized developer experience and fast performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project locally, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 16.8)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/next-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd next-app
```

3. Install dependencies:

Using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

Using Yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```

### Development

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```
or if you're using Yarn:
```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production

To build and start the application for production:

1. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```
or with Yarn:
```bash
yarn build
```

2. Start the production server:

```bash
npm start
```
or with Yarn:
```bash
yarn start
```

The production build will now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Scripts

- `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`: Starts the app in development mode.
- `npm run build` or `yarn build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm start` or `yarn start`: Starts the production server.

## Features

- **Optimized Performance**: Automatic static optimization and server-side rendering for fast page loads.
- **API Routes**: Create API endpoints within the application using the `pages/api` directory.
- **File-Based Routing**: Pages are automatically routed based on the `pages` directory.
- **Image Optimization**: Built-in support for optimized images, improving performance and load times.
